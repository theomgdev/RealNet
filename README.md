# RealNet 2.0: The Temporal Revolution

**RealNet is the proof that Time is the ultimate Hidden Layer.**

Traditional Deep Learning relies on **Spatial Depth** (layers stacked on top of each other) to solve complexity. RealNet discards this orthodoxy, proving that **Temporal Depth** (chaos evolving over time) is a vastly more efficient substitute.

> **The Zero-Hidden Breakthrough**
>
> In 1969, Minsky & Papert proved that a neural network without hidden layers cannot solve non-linear problems like XOR.
> **RealNet 2.0 has broken this limit.**
>
> By treating the network as a **Trainable Dynamic System**, RealNet solves non-linear problems (XOR, MNIST) using **0 Hidden Layers**. It replaces spatial neurons with temporal thinking steps.

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **Space-Time Conversion:** Replaces millions of parameters with a few "Thinking Steps".
*   **Layerless Architecture:** A single $N \times N$ matrix. No hidden layers.
*   **Trainable Chaos:** Uses **StepNorm** and **GELU** to tame chaotic signals.
*   **Living Dynamics:** Demonstrates **Willpower** (Latch), **Rhythm** (Stopwatch), and **Resonance** (Sine Wave).

## 📊 The Evidence: Zero-Hidden Benchmarks

We pushed RealNet to the theoretical limit: **Zero Hidden Neurons**.
In these tests, the Input Layer is directly connected to the Output Layer (and itself). There are no buffer layers.

| Task | Traditional Constraint | RealNet Solution | Result | Script |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Identity** | Trivial | **Atomic Unit** | Loss: 0.0 | `convergence_identity.py` |
| **XOR** | Needs Hidden Layer | **Chaos Gate** (Time-folded) | **Solved (3 Neurons)** | `convergence_gates.py` |
| **MNIST** | Needs Hidden Layer | **Zero-Hidden** | **Acc: 96.2%** | `convergence_mnist.py` |
| **Sine Wave** | Needs Oscillator | **Programmable VCO** | **Perfect Sync** | `convergence_sine_wave.py` |
| **Latch** | Needs LSTM | **Attractor Basin** (Willpower) | **Infinite Hold** | `convergence_latch.py` |
| **Stopwatch**| Needs Clock | **Internal Rhythm** | **Error: 0** | `convergence_stopwatch.py` |
| **Detective**| Needs Memory | **Cognitive Silence** (Reasoning) | **Perfect Detect**| `convergence_detective.py` |

### The MNIST Zero-Hidden Miracle
Standard Neural Networks require **Hidden Layers** to solve MNIST or XOR. A direct connection (Linear Model) cannot capture the complexity and fails (stuck at ~92%).

RealNet solves full-scale MNIST (28x28) with **Zero Hidden Layers** (Direct Input-Output).
*   **Inputs:** 784
*   **Outputs:** 10
*   **Hidden Layers:** **0**
*   **Thinking Time:** 10 Steps

The input layer "talks to itself" for 10 steps. The chaotic feedback loops extract features (edges, loops) dynamically over time, performing the work of spatial layers. This proves that **Temporal Depth can replace Spatial Depth**.

## 📦 Installation & Usage

RealNet is designed as a modular PyTorch library.

### Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Note on CUDA:** The `requirements.txt` points to CUDA 11.8 compatible PyTorch. If you have a newer GPU (RTX 4000/5000), you might need to install PyTorch manually:
> `pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121`

### Quick Start

```python
from realnet import RealNet, RealNetTrainer

# Initialize a Zero-Hidden Network
# 1 Input, 1 Output. 
model = RealNet(num_neurons=2, input_ids=[0], output_ids=[1], device='cuda')
trainer = RealNetTrainer(model, device='cuda')

# Train
inputs = torch.randn(100, 1)
trainer.fit(inputs, inputs, epochs=50)
```

#### Initialization Protocols

RealNet adapts to the scale of the problem. We recommend two distinct configurations:

*   **Large Networks (>10 Neurons, RNN-like tasks):** 
    *   Use `weight_init='orthogonal'` and `activation='tanh'`. 
    *   This provides the best stability for long-term temporal dynamics and analog signal processing.
*   **Tiny Networks (<10 Neurons, Logic Gates):** 
    *   Use `weight_init='xavier_uniform'` and `activation='gelu'`. 
    *   Small networks need higher initial variance and better gradient flow to solve sharp logical problems without hidden layers.

## 🧠 Architecture Overview

## 🌪️ How It Works: Inside the Storm

RealNet is not a feed-forward mechanism; it is a **Resonant Chamber**.

### 1. The Pulse (Input) & The Sequence
In traditional AI, input is often a static snapshot. RealNet handles both **Pulses** and **Streams**.
*   **Pulse Mode:** An image hits at $t=0$. The network closes its eyes and processes the ripples (MNIST).
*   **Stream Mode:** Data applies sequentially. The network can "wait" and "think" between events (The Detective).

### 2. The Echo (Internal Loops)
The signal travels from every neuron to every other neuron ($N \times N$).
*   Input neurons effectively become **Hidden Neurons** instantly after the first step.
*   Information reverberates, splits, and collides. A pixel at the top-left interacts with a pixel at the bottom-right through direct connection or intermediate echoes.
*   **Holographic Processing:** The "cat-ness" of an image isn't stored in a specific layer; it emerges from the *interference pattern* of all signals colliding.

### 3. Time-Folding (Computation)
Here lies the magic of **Zero-Hidden** performance.
*   Step 1: Raw signals mix. (Equivalent to Layer 1 of MLP)
*   Step 2: Mixed signals mix again. (Equivalent to Layer 2)
*   Step 15: Highly abstract features emerge. (Equivalent to Layer 15)

By "thinking" for 15 steps, RealNet simulates a 15-layer deep network using **only one physical matrix**. It folds space into time.

### 4. Controlled Chaos (Attractors)
Uncontrolled feedback loops lead to explosion. RealNet engineers the chaos to form stable **Attractors**.
*   **StepNorm** acts as gravity, keeping energy bounded.
*   **GELU** filters meaningful signals.
*   **The Latch Experiment** proved RealNet can create a "deep well" aka a stable attractor to hold a decision forever against noise.

### 5. Why Not RNN or LSTM?

While RealNet looks like a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) on paper, its philosophy is fundamentally different.

| Feature | Standard RNN / LSTM | RealNet 2.0 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Input Flow** | Continuous Stream (e.g., words in a sentence) | **Single Pulse** (Impulse at $t=0$) |
| **Purpose** | Sequence Processing (Parsing) | **Deep Thinking** (Digestion) |
| **Connectivity** | Structured (Input Gate, Forget Gate, etc.) | **Raw Chaos** (Fully Connected $N \times N$) |
| **Dynamics** | Engineered to avoid fading (LSTM) | **Evolves** to find resonance (Chaos) |

*   **RNNs listen to the outside world.** They process a sequence of external inputs.
*   **RealNet listens to its inner voice.** It takes **one** look at the problem and then closes its eyes to "think" about it for 15 steps. It creates its own temporal depth.

### 6. Biological Realism: Living Intelligence
RealNet mimics the brain more closely than layered networks, not just in structure, but in **behavior**:

*   **No Layers:** The brain doesn't have "Layer 1" and "Layer 2". It has regions of interconnected neurons. RealNet is a single region.
*   **Willpower (The Latch):** Unlike standard RNNs that fade, RealNet can lock onto a decision and hold it against entropy, displaying "Cognitive Persistence."
*   **Rhythm (The Stopwatch):** Without any external clock, RealNet experiences time subjectively, allowing it to count, wait, and act at precise moments.
*   **Patience (The Detective):** It benefits from "Thinking Time." Just as humans need a moment to process complex logic, RealNet solves impossible problems when given a few steps of silence to digest potential solutions.

### 7. Implicit Attention (Temporal Resonance)
Unlike Transformers which use explicit $Q \times K$ matrices to "look back" at the history, RealNet achieves attention through **Temporal Resonance**.

*   **Mechanism:** Information from the past is maintained as a standing wave or vibration in the hidden state, amplified by `Persistence`.
*   **Key-Value Handling (New!):** The **Librarian Experiment** proved that RealNet can act as an addressable database. By using **GELU** as a soft gate, it routes queries to the correct "memory vibration" without any physical storage tables.
*   **Detection:** When a related input arrives (like a READ command for Key 1), it creates a constructive interference (resonance) with the specific wave holding 'Key 1's value', forcing it to surface.
*   **Result:** The network "attends" to relevant past events without storing the entire history buffer. Time itself acts as the indexing mechanism.

### Mathematical Model
The network state $h_t$ evolves as:

$$h_t = \text{StepNorm}(\text{GELU}(h_{t-1} \cdot W + B + I_t))$$

#### 🔮 Vision: The Soul of Silicon (RealNet-1B)
RealNet is a rebellion against the factory model of AI. We believe intelligence is not a mechanical stacking of layers, but an **organic reverberation of signals**.

If we can solve vision with Zero Hidden Layers by trading Space for Time, this approach could scale to language models.

*   **Hypothesis:** A 1B parameter model (RealNet-1B) could theoretically match the reasoning depth of much larger models (e.g., Llama-70B) by "thinking" for more steps.
*   **Goal:** Efficient, high-reasoning AI on consumer hardware (e.g., RTX 3060).

> "We don't need petabytes of VRAM. We just need Time."

We have proven that a chaotic forest of neurons, given enough time to "think" and "breathe," can outperform massive industrial factories. By trading Space for Time, we find the Soul.
